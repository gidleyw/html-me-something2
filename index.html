				<p>Furniture stores have furniture. Grocery Stores have food. I don't think about ice cream at night.
                    I don't make the rules up. I follow them when I can. 14 steps to the top. 
				</p>

				<p>I told him no, I don't want to play - but ask me again and I'll have to hand you that L real quick. He did and I'm too competitive to say no. 
                    He went for a layup - I moved out the way and next think I remember is my ankle received the L. I forgot what this felt like it has been so long.
				</p>

				<p>I can still walk, I can get to the top of these steps. Every step hurts so much but I need to get my laptop to do my homework. 
                    Looks like I need to go up the steps... One step at a time...
